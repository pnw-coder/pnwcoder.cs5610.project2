Project Writeup

1. I faced a few challenges when building this app. Working with html and css in the first project was a little more straightforward albeit limiting. It is nice to have the power of React but I did often find myself struggling with managing the state of my components. After playing around with the useContext and useState hooks I did feel more comfortable in implementing them and I believe that I correclty used them in my app. Making sure that the file structure of my components was correct was also a little challenging for me as I was having trouble getting my app to render but I was able to find a fix for that.

2. Given more time I would have liked to implement the heatmap feature. I tried for a while trying to troubleshoot getting the state correct between my Box, Grid, and GridProvider components but whenever I tried to run my heatmap function it did not work. I think this is where I really struggled to wrap my head around passing data between the different components. I would also like to make some design changes to my website as well. I wanted to go for a more simplistic design where the user's focus is drawn to the app rather than the background but I think I could do a better job at making the design look nicer. 

3. I made a few assumptions while working on this assignment. The first assumption is that user's know what Conway's Game of Life is and are familiar with how it functions. A user should be able to understand the buttons at the bottom of the screen and what their effect will do. I also made the assumption that a user will interact with the grid itself to make patterns if none exist when a grid resets. Sometimes the cells are generated too far apart to create patterns but a user can click on squares to directly create patterns. 

4. This assignment took me approximately 1 week to complete.
